I've been messing around with quite a lot of terminal programs recently so I
thought the best thing to do would be to write a little bit about some of the
programs, tools and utilities I've found.~

Installing
----------
### Package Managers
A package manager is your best friend here. Those of you who are using a [Linux
distribution][1] have a head start here as these are already well established
and full of packages on your platform. Mac OS X users have a few unofficial
options for package managers:

* [Macports][2] - Probably the most popular but it sometimes takes a while for
  the newest packages to get put into the repositories.
* [Fink][3] - I've never used it and people seem to claim that it's not as good
  as *Macports*. That's all I've got about it.
* [Brew][4] - The package manager I use. Packages are updated as fast as the
  owner can pull people changes into the repository. Everything that I've
  installed with it has worked flawlessly.

If you are a Mac user you should probably choose one of these. You can also
install stuff from source but if you're like me then you'd rather not do that
unless you have to and there is a perfectly good package waiting for you to
use. For the rest of this blog post I'll be using *Brew*.

Installation instructions for *Brew* can be found [here][5]. I used the script
that is provided at the top of the page and everything turned out fine. This is
the recommended way to install *Brew* as everything will be in the default
place and it will all be shiny.

Now that you have what you need to get the most of your dependencies and
programs we can move onto installing some of the more specialised installers.

### Python
*Python* is a pretty cool language but it does suffer from having some terrible
package management. The 'official' package management program for *Python* is
`easy_install` which is included in `setuptools`.

Mac OS X already has `easy_install` included in the base install. Ubuntu users
will have to run this command to install it:

    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev build-essential

Now, very much like Internet Explorer is only good for installing another
browser `easy_install` is only good for installing `pip`. It provides much
better feedback, native support for other version control systems (*Git*,
*Mercurial* and *Bazaar*) when installing and it also allows for the
uninstallation of packages. To install it (both OS X and Linux) tap this out on
your keyboard and apply pressure to your return key:

    sudo easy_install pip

Now that's installed you're ready to install *Python* applications!

### Ruby
*Ruby* is a very, very cool language but it still has some issues with it's
packaging like *Python*. Luckily there is one main solution for this and it's
pretty good. *Rubygems* is the standard Ruby packaging system and it's pretty
good at what it does. Mac OS X already has *Rubygems* installed but on Ubuntu
you need to install it yourself but it's pretty painless just go:

    sudo apt-get install rubygems

Once you have that installed you're ready to install *Ruby* applications!

### Usage
* Brew: `brew install <package name>`
* Pip: `pip install <package name>`
* Gem: `gem install <package name>`

Useful Programs
---------------
### hub
As you may know I'm a huge fan of the *Git* VCS and the corresponding site,
[github.com][6]. `hub` connects the two and makes common operations much
easier, simpler and more efficient. It does this by providing shortcuts with
extensions to old commands and whole new ones. Definitely worth downloading if
you use *Github*.

* Homepage: <http://defunkt.github.com/hub/hub.1.html>
* Install Command:
    * Mac OS X: `brew install hub`
    * Linux: <http://github.com/defunkt/hub/blob/master/README.md>

### showoff
*Showoff* is a tool for creating and presenting presentations. Slides are
written in an extended form of [Markdown][7] and then rendered and served by
*Showoff*. You can then view the finished presentation in a browser. *Showoff*
is aimed at a more technical presentation style. These presentations can also
be deployed to [Heroku][8]. An example presentation that I've been writing can
be found [here][9]. Anyway, it's pretty cool: try it out.

* Homepage: <http://github.com/schacon/showoff>
* Install Command: `gem install showoff`

### cheat
*Cheat* provides access to a repository of community edited cheat-sheets that
allow for up-to-date help and tips to a wide variety of tools. It's pretty
useful and can be far more readable than man pages. [Here][10] is the example
output of the `cheat git` command.

* Homepage: <http://cheat.errtheblog.com/>
* Install Command: `gem install cheat`

### homesick
*Homesick* is a tool for moving your dotfiles easily between two computers and
also allowing for easy sharing of configuration files between different people.
Installing a set of configuration files is as easy as:

    homesick clone technicalpickles/pickled-vim
    homesick symlink pickled-vim

This will link the files into your home directory for immediate use. The only
requirement is that you give it a git repository with your dotfiles in a set
arrangement.

* Homepage: <http://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick>
* Install Command: `gem install homesick`

### ack
*Ack* is a tool like `grep` for programmers. It allows for the search of large
quantities of source code. It adds some useful features over `grep` such as:

* Really fast.
* Ignores files that you don't want to search, such as:
    * `.git` and `.svn` directories
    * backup files, `name~` and `#name#`
* Coloured output (shiny)
* Specify what kind of files you want to search, `--no-perl` `--ruby`

* Homepage: <http://betterthangrep.com/>
* Example Output: <http://gist.github.com/377773>
* Install Command: `brew install ack`

Well, that's 5. I was planning on doing more but I think that's enough for now.
I'll probably make another post with some more in at some point in the near
future. Hope you try a new program today. :)
